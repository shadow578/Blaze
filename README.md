# ðŸ”¥Blaze
Create Text templates and stop repeating yourself when typing!

## Save time when typing
Are you tired of typing the same phrase (fore example "I'm looking forward to meeting you") over and over again?
With Blaze, you can just type the shortcut #meet instead and the text will immediately be inserted where you want it.
